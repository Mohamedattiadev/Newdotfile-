# ===================================================================
#  MPV Config for Tiling Window Managers (Recommended)
# ===================================================================

# --- Window Behavior ---
# This is the MOST IMPORTANT setting for use with a tiling WM.
# It tells mpv to NOT fight with Qtile over the window size.
# Qtile is in control, mpv just draws inside the given window.
keepaspect-window=no

# Removes the window title bar for a cleaner look, which is
# perfect for a floating window controlled by a script.
no-border

# --- Video Scaling ---
# Keep the video's original aspect ratio to prevent distortion.
# The video will scale to fit the window, adding black bars if necessary.

keepaspect=yes


keep-open=yes
