  - **Weekly Focus:** This plan balances Full-Stack (60%), AI (25%), German (10%), and Trading (5%) over the year. Trading study is strictly capped at 20 min/day to maintain focus and avoid emotional decisions.
  - **Projects:** The goal is a deployable, portfolio-worthy project each quarter (e.g., Q1: CRUD app, Q2: Task Manager with tests, Q3/Q4: Next.js app with an integrated AI feature).
